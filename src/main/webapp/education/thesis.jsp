                <h2>Thesis Abstract: </h2>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roads, trails, and pathways, and the way they are formed, have the ability to shape the areas where they are located.  Eighteenth century roadways in New Jersey, located between two cities that were both experiencing population and economic growth, led to a more distinct homogeneity in the colony.  First viewed as two ostensibly different areas, a Dutch East Jersey, and a Swedish West Jersey, by the time of the American Revolution the colony would come to be seen as one.  In 1702, the two provinces of East Jersey and West Jersey were united under a royal charter.  However, after this point it was still referred to as the Jerseys, that is to say that New Jersey was still thought of in terms of East and West.  However, this cultural difference and the east/west labels would not be in use for very long.<br/>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my thesis, I analyze the development of roads from New York City to Philadelphia in the eighteenth century, intersecting New Jersey, and the effect this had on the social and regional perspectives of the colony.  I use documents from the State Archives in Trenton, available on the internet in assorted volume.  I use Series 1, Documents Relating to the Colonial History of the State of New Jersey.  In the archives, I also use tavern license petitions for the county of Hunterdon.  For perspectives of individuals, I plan on using various travel narratives of those who made their way across the colony.  I will also be using sections from various New York and Pennsylvania newspapers such as the Pennsylvania Gazette, and the New York Gazette or Weekly Post Boy.  My paper will aim to highlight the way that the transportation infrastructure of colonial New Jersey helped to prevent the colony from being broken up, and transformed two distinct cultural and regional areas into one, leading to its own identity.

<h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the fast-paced world of today, where an appreciation of natural geography is not something with which most usually tend to occupy themselves, little attention is paid to the way things used to be.  Similarly, there is a limited desire to examine the decisions of the past that have shaped the world of today.  For instance, when driving in a car, the majority of people tend to take the quickest route, which usually entails getting on the highway and setting oneself to autopilot until their destination is reached.  This is especially commonplace in highway rich New Jersey.  For those who choose to take the road less traveled, many aesthetic rewards abound.  However, there is more to the scenic route than just pleasant views and less traffic.  Those smaller one and two lane county highways are part of a tradition that often dates back to colonial times, and even before that, to an epoch where Native Americans were the only inhabitants.  Many smaller roads and county highways are based on old colonial roadways, which themselves often followed Indian trails.  Unbeknownst to Native Americans at the time, their trails would come to have a profound effect on the development of New Jersey.  These trails would come to serve as the skeletal frame of New Jersey.
            </p>

            <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The title for this project, A Traveling Culture, has a twofold meaning.  First, it represents how the only way to really discover all of the different cultures in New Jersey is to truly travel from one end to the other.  The title also suggests the centrality of treasured roadways to New Jersey, which is the focus of this paper.  As we shall see, roads are able to provide much more than transportation.  In a general sense, this study analyzes the impact that roads can have on peoples’ perceptions of themselves through the lens of geographic location and regional identity.  This research is not simply about why people traveled, nor their methods and company for travel.  It is neither a study of how roads were built, nor a broad history of transportation in general.  These topics will be covered, but in a broader sense this is a study of identity, a New Jersey identity.
            </p>

            <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The focus of this thesis is overland travel by way of roads in New Jersey during the eighteenth century.  Most of the work pertains to New Jersey’s role as a colony rather than state.  As far as roads are concerned, there are many possible topics that are worth researching.  Roads open up different communities to one another, serving as arteries for transporting goods and services, as well as ideas and news, or other information.  The location of New Jersey itself played a vital part in the impact of these roads.  New Jersey is situated between two of the most important cities in the colonies during this time:  New York City and Philadelphia.  The roads that connected those cities helped to alter and shape the future of New Jersey, giving it a heritage that is entirely its own.
            </p>

            <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First viewed as two ostensibly different colonies, a Dutch northeastern Jersey, and a Swedish southwestern Jersey, the differences between the two halves would continue to grow throughout the eighteenth century.  In 1702, the two provinces of East and West Jersey were united under a royal charter.  However, after this point the region was still referred to as the Jerseys, which is to say that New Jersey was still thought of in terms of east and west, instead of as a singular whole.  However, the cultural difference and the east/west labels would diminish, and by the time of the American Revolution the colony would come to be seen as one.
            </p>

            <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From its founding until the present, New Jersey has had the luxury of location.  Aside from waterways over the Atlantic Ocean and the Delaware River, the only practical way from Philadelphia to New York City is through New Jersey.  Although some may have viewed New Jersey as an inconvenient detour between the two growing metropolises, many would come to embrace this lucrative position.  This thesis aims to reveal the early phases of this embracement by analyzing the roads connecting Philadelphia and New York City.  The vehicle for analysis are various roads that went between the two cities, as well as the shift in mood and attitude in the colony.  Additionally, this thesis assesses an early stage of New Jersey during which residents came to accept its role as a go-between.

                <h4>Chapter 1:  A State of Forgottenness</h4>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since its founding, the Colony of New Jersey was subject to land disputes, diverse settlement patterns, a pairing with New York under that colony’s Royal Governor, a separation into halves, and a few years as the “Cockpit of the Revolution,” all before even becoming a state.<a href="#note1" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>1</sup></a>   Historical analysis of New Jersey’s roads has also been presented.  There are studies of its two most recognizable roads built in the twentieth century:  the New Jersey Turnpike, and the Garden State Parkway.<a href="#note2"style="text-decoration: none"><sup>2</sup></a>   In fact the concept of New Jersey having a special tie to its road system is nothing new.  Most New Jersey residents today pride themselves on their proximity to both New York and Philadelphia.  It is likely the only state where some drivers feel the urge to put a bumper sticker on their vehicle that displays which exit is “theirs”.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are histories of New Jersey that predate the American Revolution.  For example, Samuel Smith’s The History of the Colony of Nova-Caesaria, or New Jersey, was written in the mid eighteenth century, when it was still part of British North America.<a href="#note3" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>3</sup></a>   New Jersey has undergone treatment from military historians for its role in the American Revolution, and also its importance during the Industrial Revolution.<a href="#note4" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>4</sup></a>   The literature themes about New Jersey are as diverse as the colony itself:  however, certain subjects have been overlooked.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although general histories of New Jersey are plentiful, few deal exclusively with the roadways during the colonial period.  At the beginning of the twentieth century, lawyer and historian Francis Bazley Lee finished his four-volume New Jersey as a Colony and State, one of the earliest broad treatments of the history of New Jersey during its colonial, revolution, and early republic periods.<a href="#note5" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>5</sup></a>   He discusses colonial roadways, albeit not in great detail.  He was perhaps the first to make mention of a barrier that existed between New Brunswick and Trenton, or east and west New Jersey, during the colonial period.<a href="#note6" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>6</sup></a>   His book is without notes, but is meticulously researched and well written, providing valuable access to information that can be confirmed by other sources.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The concept of colonial roadways being raised from old Indian trails is a common theme in books that touch on New Jersey’s early road systems.  Wheaton J. Lane’s From Indian Trail to Iron Horse:  Travel and Transportation in New Jersey 1620-1860, published in 1939, is perhaps the most useful work that pertains to the actual development of the roads in colonial New Jersey.  The influence of the Indian trails is displayed in the title.  Like Lee, he discusses the barrier between the settlements on the Delaware and the Atlantic coast, known today as the Pine Barrens.  Being entirely devoted to the methods of transportation, the author brings new historical concepts to the table, such as the idea that Philadelphia was the gateway to the west, and many who would eventually make their way there had to pass through New Jersey.  This is an important idea when framed within the context of the effect these roads had on the local populations.  The most borrowed theme in this book is the idea of the Indian trails being the foundation for later colonial roadways.<a href="#note7" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>7</sup></a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More in depth studies of colonial roadways are lacking, with most road analysis pertaining to the automobile age and after.  Fellow Travelers, by Philip Levy, examines the Indian trails leading westward, which is somewhat useful, as it reinforces the understanding of the transformation of Indian trails into colonial roadways.  However, it focuses almost exclusively on westward migration, and the phenomenon of Indians and settlers traveling together.<a href="#note8" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>8</sup></a>   Geoffrey Hindley’s A History of Roads devotes only a single chapter to American roads, which encompasses the entire nation, leaving New Jersey colonial roadways out of its scope.<a href="#note9" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>9</sup></a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Clearly the body of historical work on New Jersey’s colonial roadways leaves much to be desired.  Studies into geographical and cultural types of development have been more abundant.  There is a host of studies dedicated to the original Swedish and Dutch settlers in New Jersey.  There is also a book dedicated to the high concentration of Scots in the eastern province during the proprietary period.<a href="#note10" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>10</sup></a>   Less detailed are the more general books about the formative period of New Jersey history, which devote small sections to settlement patterns and developing cultures and societies.  There are also works that highlight the different types of geography in New Jersey, which for a small territory, is rich in various types of terrain.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New Jersey historian Charles S. Boyer has written numerous books on the state.  Rambles Through Old Highways and Byways of West Jersey points out that most of the roads in the south led to or from Philadelphia and most of the roads in the north ran to or from New York.<a href="#note11" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>11</sup></a>   This may seem obvious today, but the idea is important for understanding the development of two different New Jersey sections, one east and one west.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To tie the two categories of cultural and geographical history together, we must turn to Peter O. Wacker.  In Land and People, A Cultural Geography of Preindustrial New Jersey:  Origins and Settlement Patterns, he merges the two fields together giving colonial New Jersey a fresh and highly detailed perspective.  He discusses the origins of the colony by relying on early twentieth century scholars such as John Edwin Pomfret, and also the Indian trails by citing Wheaton J. Lane, mentioned above, and Dorothy Cross.  What makes his book important is not just the relation he gives between the geography and settlement patterns, but also his contributions to the expanding knowledge of the colonial roads.  Wacker presents detailed sections on road legislation, and provides the reader with different primary sources from those who were instrumental in determining the course of the roads.<a href="#note12" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>12</sup></a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to New Jersey early road histories and the history of the colony's geographic and settlement patterns, there exist folk histories.  These works are not written as scholarly analysis, but are informative nonetheless.  These writers have often done extensive research, and the content of these works is useful because the writers usually live in the area, and travel around talking to other local history experts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One of these folk histories that is particularly pertinent for the use of roads during this time period is Walter Hamilton Van Hoesen and his Early Taverns and Stagecoach Days in New Jersey.  This work sheds light on the different roads that were in use during this time.  It makes reference to a handful of travelers who journeyed through New Jersey stopping at these taverns.  The bulk of the book is dedicated to different regions of New Jersey, and the taverns that were located there.  However, there is a chapter on the post roads, lending helpful insight into the various stage-coach routes.<a href="#note13" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>13</sup></a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The most relevant folk history for my topic is Along the Old York Road by James S. Cawley and Margaret Cawley.  The Old York Road, sometimes referred to as York road depending on location, was known later in the eighteenth century for being the road of the Swift Sure Stage Coach Line, which its owners proudly boasted as being the quickest route from New York City to Philadelphia.  The authors discuss the origins of the road, advertisements for it, and other similar things which have been integral to my research.<a href="#note14" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>14</sup></a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anne de Benneville Mears completed The Old York Road:  And Its Early Associations of History and Biography, 1670-1870, in 1890.  This local history, although dealing with the same Old York Road as this paper, holds little relevance, due to her focus on the history of that road in Pennsylvania.  She details the early origins and development of said road, but unfortunately, neglects anything relating to New Jersey.<a href="#note15" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>15</sup></a>  Another scholar writing towards the end of the nineteenth century was Townsend Ward.  His essay “The Germantown Road and Its Associations” examines that road and its various historical involvements.  Unfortunately for New Jersey, this article is about the Germantown Road in Pennsylvania, and is more narrative story telling than thoughtful analysis.  He does point out that there is “no doubt” that the origins of the Germantown Road followed Indian paths, a concept that can be applied to New Jersey.<a href="#note16" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>16</sup></a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another type of study invaluable to my research is what I call local folk histories.  These are focused histories of local communities, written or produced by various historical societies.  They often lack notes or an index, but their value lies in the specific, detailed narratives of such small communities and areas, much of which is passed over in general histories of New Jersey.  Each county has a local folk history, with smaller towns receiving treatment as well.  For example, in Hunterdon County, East Amwell has its own history, as well as the county itself.<a href="#note17" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>17</sup></a>   Again, the value of such work is the specificity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The idea that New Jersey’s position between Philadelphia and New York City stimulated its growth is not a new concept.  In a book detailing the emergence of New Jersey’s canal system in the nineteenth century, James S. Cawley provides additional insight into the importance of this location.  The Delaware-Raritan Canal system made use of this position between the two cities.<a href="#note18" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>18</sup></a>   Linda J. Barth describes the small, middle section as the “narrow waist of New Jersey” and that it has been “a transportation corridor.”  Similar to Cawley, she mentions how the rail systems followed a similar pattern as the canals, running the shortest distance between Philadelphia and New York City.<a href="#note19" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>19</sup></a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Carl Bridenbaugh’s “The Old and New Societies of the Delaware Valley in the Seventeenth Century” is a relevant essay into development along the Delaware River.  He discusses the early settlers, as well as the impact they had on native people throughout the region.  He also draws a conclusion that is similar to one of the themes in this thesis.  Bridenbaugh cites the various transportation improvements, such as cart roads, bridges and ferries, as stimulating communication up and down the Delaware valley, from “West New Jersey to Maryland.”<a href="#note20" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>20</sup></a>   His conclusions prove valid, and my work is a continuation of this.  However, my focus is the New Jersey identity, not the Delaware, and the eighteenth century, as opposed to the seventeenth century in Bridenbaugh’s essay.  Nonetheless, his article has provided constant guidance, due in part to the thematic similarities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although New Jersey’s colonial roadways and the colony’s geographic and cultural developments have been studied, thus far there has been a void in bridging these two approaches to New Jersey history.  By researching the impact that these Indian trails-turned roads had on regional or state perception, I hope to plug the hole of missing analysis.  The main goal is to show how certain parts of a colony’s or state’s infrastructure, in this instance roads, can alter regional identities.  I believe this to be a worthwhile study because it seems to be an area that is missing thorough research, especially relating to New Jersey.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The aim of this work is twofold.  First, I show how New Jersey was the victim of assorted forces that were pulling it apart.  The various colonial developments are discussed, including schisms of ethnicity, religion, and political consciousness.  Here, the reasons why East and West Jersey were moving apart from each other are outlined and explained.  I give examples of various people referring to New Jersey by plural eponyms, many who were travelers or from other parts of the country.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Second, I show how New Jersey was able to transcend the east/west dichotomy and emerge as a single entity around the time of the American Revolution.  I provide evidence of the transforming regional identity associated with New Jersey throughout the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the influence the roads had on repositioning this identity.  There are many instances where proximity to New York City or Philadelphia is embraced as economically beneficial.  Also included are examples of individuals giving their personal perception of New Jersey by the way they labeled it.  Descriptions of the colony as plural or singular are telling clues, especially during certain periods of the colony’s existence.  Many of the sources come from colonial newspapers, as well as various writings.  I end by discussing the implications the American Revolution had on shaping and encapsulating the idea of an early New Jersey legacy or identity.

                <h4>Chapter 2:  A State Divided Stands</h4>


<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certain legacies have a way of attaching themselves to different areas or regions.  These legacies are usually not encompassing enough to be applied to larger nations as a whole, but subdivisions such as a state, or region of a state.  In the case of New Jersey, a prominent part of its legacy can be attributed to its geographic location.  In many ways, New Jersey's position can be viewed as ideal, cushioned between two much larger states with their major cities each on the borders of New Jersey.  New York and Philadelphia are cities rich in history, containing important political and commercial centers, and large populations.  Fortunately for New Jersey, the only feasible overland connection between these two cities is through that state.  This has been an influence on much of the infrastructural development in New Jersey, as well as a sense of state purpose, and eventually, a legacy as the great link between two of the oldest and most celebrated cities in America.  It would be too forthright to suggest that this is New Jersey's only legacy.  It is the “Garden State” after all, due to its rich, bountiful soils.  And the beach towns and resorts have become an iconic New Jersey tradition.  However, the oldest and most consequential legacy of New Jersey has been its position as the medium which connects New York City with Philadelphia.  There is a sense of Jerseyness related to this, which is surprising, given the way the colony was formed and evolved.
</p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To understand the early stages of New Jersey taking on the role of intermediary between New York City and Philadelphia, the early settlement patterns must be discussed and analyzed.  With the English settling the northern and southern portions of what would become the original 13 Colonies, the mid-Atlantic region was largely unoccupied.  The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in New Jersey, colonizing the area around New York City and northeastern New Jersey.  A short time later arrived Swedes, who did their part by establishing New Sweden in the southwest along the Delaware.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The reason these two powers chose these areas for settlement is most likely due to their proximity to navigable waterways, the Delaware and Hudson Rivers.<a href="#note21" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>21</sup></a>  This helps to explain why from the beginning, these two edges of New Jersey were first settled.  Usable waterways were essential in a land where the closest things to roads were the Indian paths and trails sprawling across the area.  The importance of these Indian trails, crude and narrow, lay mainly in the fact that the Indians were, without realization, a huge influence on the future landscape and legacy of New Jersey.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to lending name origins to many places in the country, Native Americans also provided rough outlines for many future roadways.<a href="#note22" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>22</sup></a>   When they were unable to move themselves by water, they created paths and trails.  Many of these trails are concentrated in the direction between the future sites of New York City and Philadelphia (Figure 2.1).<a href="#note23" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>23</sup></a>   These Indian trails were created with the least amount of effort, where possible, avoiding steep hills, impassable fields of large rocks, thick forests, and swampy marshes.  The colonists would convert these small Indian paths into “thoroughfares and cart and rolling roads,” for the early fur and tobacco trade.<a href="#note24" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>24</sup></a>   This helps to explain why many of the smaller roads that would be based on these trails are winding, rather than the most direct route.  This is much unlike later man-made highways and turnpikes where speed and convenience were the goal.<a href="#note25" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>25</sup></a>   These modern highways, however, are still largely based on accommodating the flow of traffic between New York City and Philadelphia.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So we have it that two different areas of New Jersey were founded by the first countries to settle the region, one in the northeast, the other in the southwest.  More than just different regions, the northeast-southwest bifurcation took on great significance as the blueprint for New Jersey's future separation.  Each region had its own cultures and customs, as well as separate heritage and dialects.  This is the first display of a force or complication working to pull New Jersey apart.  This process is well known in Europe and Asia, where two very different groups occupy the same region, with the eventual spirit of nationalism making each group fervent for their own nation-state.  New Jersey may have been spared this fate, as the Dutch and Swedish colonizing agents were not in control for long.  Regardless, it shows how during the early stage of European settlement, New Jersey was a symbiosis between different groups.  However, the British, who assumed control of both regions, made an even greater impression upon New Jersey.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1664 Captain Nicolls, an Englishman, sailed into New Amsterdam and coerced the city to surrender without bloodshed.  Overnight, the land switched hands to become a possession of England.  The area that was to become New Jersey was granted by King Charles II to his brother, the future monarch James II.  James Duke of York was given the expanse of land between Maryland and New England.  Not long after he was given the land, James in turn offered part of his territory to two associates who had remained loyal Cavaliers during the English Civil War (1642-1651), Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret.  The following deed was drawn up, and a boundary was to be marked for:
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that tract of land lying and being to the westward of Long Island and Manhitas Island and bounded on the east part by the main sea and part by Hudson’s river and hath upon the West Delaware Bay or river and to the northward as far as the northernmost branch of the said Bay or River of Delaware which is 41° 40° of latitude and crosseth over thence in a straight line to Hudson’s River in 41° of latitude, which said tract of land is hereafter to be called by the name or names of Nova Cesarea or New Jersey.”<a href="#note26" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>26</sup></a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jersey was the name of an Island in the English Channel that remained loyal to the King during the English Civil War, and the name was borrowed for the new province.  From the legal deed reproduced above, it appears that the earliest legal partition of New Jersey was sloppy.  The chiseling out of New Jersey from the mid-Atlantic region that includes Pennsylvania and New York was a crude rendering of a boundary.  In time, a dispute would arise over New Jersey’s northern border with New York.  The area on the Delaware where New Jersey would end was left vague.  As shown in the map in Figure 2.2, the area marking New Jersey's northern border was not entirely clear.  The expectation was that New Jersey would have this northwest panhandle, as this is the northern most point of the Delaware at 41° latitude.

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In March 1673, Berkeley sold his half to John Fenwick and Edward Byllinge, two members of the Society of Friends.  Byllinge, who supplied most of the money for the purchase, soon found his funds depleted, and had to recruit more Quaker partners to buy into his investment, one of them being William Penn.  Here we see the second display of New Jersey’s possible alternative development.  For a time, the proprietors for West Jersey were predominantly Quaker.  This half of the colony could have naturally been absorbed into Penn’s Philadelphia, a city with Quaker origins.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After New Jersey was split into two halves, there were disputes over where the official separating line would be.  Not surprisingly, the board of proprietors for each half wanted a larger share of land.  The first line delineating the half controlled by Carteret, and the half owned by the Society of Friends was the Providence Line in 1676.  Here, a line was marked off from Barnegat to an undetermined area on the Delaware below Rankokus Creek.  The trustees for the Society of Friends were not pleased with this agreement, and petitioned Carteret for a new partition.  Starting at Little Egg Harbor and continuing northwest to the Delaware at 41° latitude, this was known as the Quintipartite Deed, which, according to Historian Edwin P. Tanner, was the beginning of two separate colonies.<a href="#note27" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>27</sup></a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1702, the two proprietary governments were joined together by union, and a Royal Government was introduced.  This was agreed to by all the members of both boards of proprietors with them being able to retain certain benefits, such as unrestricted Indian trade.  They also had a say in establishing the new procedures for the Royal Government.  Despite the union of the two Jerseys, neither half was quick to view New Jersey as a whole.  Another official division line was finally agreed upon in 1743, known as the Lawrence Line (see figure 2.3).  These invented lines, created to detach the two halves of New Jersey, were common examples of the discord that existed in the colony.  Reflecting on the acts passed by the New Jersey assembly of 1719, Mr. West wrote to the Lords of Trade in England about the partition line between the two halves of the colony, which he viewed as necessary for "preventing disputes concerning the same [east and west division]."<a href="#note28" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>28</sup></a>   Separation through political means is not a trait generally associated with homogenous groups.  Throughout much of this early history, political instability was a marked feature of New Jersey.  It was not clear whether the Duke of York had the “power to confer political control,” or just ownership of land.<a href="#note29" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>29</sup></a>   With these various complications, colonial New Jersey was rarely considered as a single, united colony; these developments were pushing the two Jerseys apart.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In time, New Jersey would come to accept, if not ultimately embrace, its place as the connector between New York City and Philadelphia.  It may seem obvious that this would happen, as these cities were two of the biggest commercial and residential centers in the country from an early date.  It is undeniable that regardless of the roadways, the population of New Jersey was inextricably tied to the success of New York City and Philadelphia.  However, by studying its colonial history, it becomes clear that the New Jersey we know today only emerged as a condition of chance.  There is no reason to think of New Jersey as a natural union; the possibility of the two halves remaining separate was quite real.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From the beginning, the eastern portion of New Jersey was associated with New York City, and the western with Philadelphia.<a href="#note30" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>30</sup></a>   New Jersey was for all intents and purposes, two separate provinces, and, as Historian Maxine N. Lurie points out, was “the only [emphasis added] proprietary colony broken into two (Figure 2.4).”<a href="#note31" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>31</sup></a>   Before throwing off the yolk of British subjection, each half of New Jersey was on its own path of development.  Still, after achieving statehood in the aftermath of the American Revolution, New Jersey could have remained split, with the two halves incorporated into their respective cities.  Alternatively, New Jersey could have neglected its focus on roads linking the two cities, and kept water as the main mode of transportation.  Regardless, the presence of strong factors which could, perhaps even should have formed New Jersey into two separate states, is undeniable.  At the very least, an incorporation of the eastern province with New York, and the western with Philadelphia, seemed likely.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first factor touched on above was the arrival of two distinctly different mother countries, The Netherlands and Sweden.  These two nations were different in myriad ways, not only in ethnicity, but in the areas of their colonies.  Each of these two groups set up camp at the furthest reaches of what would become New Jersey.  This ethnic diversity would continue, exemplified by the period when a majority of proprietors for the eastern division were Scots.<a href="#note32" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>32</sup></a>   New Jersey's settler origins could not have begun in a less cohesive atmosphere.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After English speakers conquered the area, there was still a large disparity between the two halves of the province.  When Berkeley sold his original half to two Quaker members, the province was further split, both figuratively and literally.  As has been mentioned, for a time William Penn was a shareholder of the West Jersey land right around the time he was laying down the grid for Philadelphia.  At this stage, it would have seemed natural that the Quaker domain in the southwest would grow into an extension of Philadelphia.  They were adjacent territories, with similar Quaker roots.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The east and west halves each had their own governments.  The Board of Proprietors for East Jersey was, for a time, linked to that of New York City.  Each half, east and west, had its own capital at Perth Amboy and Burlington respectively.  Boundary lines and capital placement were not the only issues which aroused contention.  When the first Royal Governor, Lord Cornbury, held a meeting with the New Jersey General Assembly in 1703, a debate erupted over the problem of stamping documents.  Lord Cornbury thought "the Writts ought to Isue under the great seale of the Province, and there being noe great seale yet... some were of opinion the Proprietors seale of West Jersey should be made use of, others were for that of East Jersey."  It was finally decided that Lord Cornbury would use his own seal.<a href="#note33" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>33</sup></a>   Personal accounts can be used to support the typical association of New Jersey as multiple parts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apart from ethnic, political, religious, and boundary differences between the two halves, there is also evidence of this east/west separation by the way people referred to New Jersey.  It was common to call the colony by the plural “The Jerseys”, or to use the east/west prefixes.  Rarely was it mentioned as its proper, singular name of New Jersey after it began its literal and figurative split.  Jasper Danckaerts came to New Netherland in 1679 to find a good location for a community, keeping a diary and traveling through New Jersey.  By his account, he was told the history of New Jersey up to that point, saying how the “easterly part” went to Carteret and “the westerly part” to Berkeley, however, “without a boundary line between them.”<a href="#note34" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>34</sup></a>   He was aware that New Jersey was under control of two men, but he had no notion that the province was anything other than one “N. Jarnisee [New Jersey].”<a href="#note35" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>35</sup></a>   This shows how until the late seventeenth century, New Jersey was viewed as a single colony.  However, it is not long after that we begin to see New Jersey splitting apart, as a majority of the sources would soon refer to New Jersey in the plural.

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cuthbert Potter was sent from Virginia to New England as a messenger in 1690.  This was only about 10 years after Danckaerts, but he mentions an “East Jersey” in his journal.<a href="#note36" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>36</sup></a>   Moving forward 75 years, we find New Jersey still being referred to as distinct pieces of a loosely connected whole.  An unnamed British officer, in 1764, makes a reference to “this Province [Pennsylvania] and the Jerseys.”<a href="#note37" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>37</sup></a>   A few pages later he calls each part by its proper name when referring to the capital cities of “Perth-Amboy—the principal Town of East Jersey, as Burlington on Delawar,…is of West Jersey.”<a href="#note38" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>38</sup></a>   One year later, in 1765, an unknown French traveler also made reference to the “new Jersys,” and was familiar with the history of New Jersey when he talks about how they are “divided into East and west, amboy is Capitl of the first, and Burlington… Capital of west Jersy.”<a href="#note39" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>39</sup></a>   References to the two Jersies are not only found in diaries, but also in official records.  Benjamin Franklin carried out a census of New Jersey for the years 1745, and 1737/8.  In the document, the eastern and western divisions of the colony are each treated separately.<a href="#note40" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>40</sup></a>   Clearly, it was not just travelers but native people and agencies that were accustomed to New Jersey being two different parts.

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; William Edmundson, early Quaker missionary from Ireland, arrived in Shrewsbury near Sandy Hook, in eastern Jersey in 1683.  He had planned to travel through New Jersey to Maryland with a few companions, crossing the Delaware River at the falls.  They hired an Indian as a guide, but “he took…[them] wrong, and left…[them] in the woods.”  After resting until morning, they decided to head back by the course they came and make their way to the Raritan River.  Here they were able to find “a small path that led to Delaware Falls.” This incident presents the neglected focus on travel between the two Jerseys early on.  The center of New Jersey between east and west was undeveloped and rustic, which Edmundson himself labeled as “the wilderness.”  At this time, little effort was made to connect the two provinces.  Even the Indian guide was unable to navigate through this uninhabited land, eventually leaving the party stranded, much to the dismay of Edmundson and company.  However, Edmundson’s debacle does shed light on New Jersey’s future road construction.  The place where they found the path on the Raritan River was known to be “a small landing-place from New York.”<a href="#note41" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>41</sup></a>   The road that they eventually came to traverse was one that coursed from New York to the Delaware falls, near Trenton.  This path closely resembled the future roads that would be used for linking New York City to Philadelphia.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometime between the founding of New Jersey and the ratification of the Constitution, New Jersey was formed back into a single entity.  It has been shown that since its earliest days, New Jersey had had a complication of forces working to split it into two autonomous provinces.  However, the land of New Jersey retained these two dissimilar parts, and eventually developed its own identity as the crossroads between New York City and Philadelphia.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The following chapter examines the early development of this legacy by looking at the roads that connected the two cities.  I trace the early signs that display knowledge of New Jersey's key position.  This is accomplished by looking at tavern licenses for towns located on these roads between the two cities.  Also, I study colonial newspapers that advertise for settlers in New Jersey, as well as stage-coach routes.  Taken into consideration are writings of important political figures of the eighteenth century that had to travel through New Jersey, as well as the colony's early Royal Governors.

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So far it has been shown how New Jersey had been subject to various internal divisions based on its historic roots.  Known today for its eclectic mix of cultures and ethnicities, New Jersey was diverse even from its founding.  Two different settling nations and locales, and the east/west administrative split worked to keep New Jersey separate.  However, New Jersey ratified the Constitution in 1787, and was the third state admitted into the newly formed Republic.  Somehow, it was able to retain and deepen its own identity, in spite of its divisions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Boundaries as they are understood today are somewhat of a recent development.  The concept of state or territorial boundaries in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was more elastic.  It is true that most of New Jersey is surrounded by water, largely isolating it from its neighbors.  Still, it would not have seemed out of place if New Jersey had ignored its natural boundaries and grown into two distinct areas, or if the two halves were incorporated into their respective cities, West Jersey with Philadelphia, and East Jersey with New York.  The natural boundaries were conditional, which was noticed by Robert Quary in a letter to the Lords of Trade, writing "there being only a river that parts the two Provinces."<a href="#note42" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>42</sup></a>   The boundaries of New Jersey must not be thought of as being so concrete, but were in fact, malleable, liable to change and alteration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One fundamental concept that helped to preserve a certain New Jersey identity was purpose.   There were noticeable ethnic and religious differences, as well as political separation, all within such a small area.  With such disparity and lack of cohesion, New Jersey had little to preserve itself as its own distinctively separate colony or state.  What New Jersey did have was a valuable position.  Documents relating to roads and travel help to show how this position was embraced, and from this, a New Jersey sense of purpose emerged.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To illustrate New Jersey's awareness and growing attachment to its role as a gateway, we must turn to examples that identify the colony's important location, or that advance the benefits to be had by acting as the intermediary between two prosperous cities.  In the documents, there are abundant examples that mention areas in New Jersey being close to X, or on the road to Y.  This may have been common in any of the colonies, but it seems to be emphasized in New Jersey, which, when weighing options in the eighteenth century, had little else to offer besides its proximity and easy access between New York City and Philadelphia.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although the majority of commercial and industrial transportation took place over water, overland travel was still important.  Also, New Jersey had little chance of securing successful ports, due to what Maxine N. Lurie points out as “the tendency of the more fully developed cities of New York and Philadelphia to drain trade and commerce.”<a href="#note43" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>43</sup></a>  Governor Burnet understood the deficiency of New Jersey's trade as well, writing in 1723 about how "New Jersey has little or no foreign Trade, but only with the two neighbouring Colonies of New York and Pensylvania."<a href="#note44" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>44</sup></a>   New Jersey’s development was far too late to compete with the trade and commerce of its neighbors, facilitated by their ports and harbors.  It was not too late, however, to cultivate New Jersey's intra-transit system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the main pathway between New York City and Philadelphia, it was inevitable that "the narrow waist" of New Jersey would develop a series of stage-coach routes.<a href="#note45" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>45</sup></a>   These were an important business.  Newspaper advertisements for the stage-coach routes display the developing knowledge of New Jersey's key location.  John Barnhill and John Mesherew operated a stage route that ran between the two cities.  Their service was advertised in newspapers, and they hailed there operation as being able to make the trip "in two days," with an overnight stop in Princeton.  It is worth noting that Barnhill was located in Philadelphia, and Masherew in New York.  For these two men, the distance between them had no negative impact on their desire to run a business.  As other documents show, the thinly developed interior of New Jersey was not a considerable obstacle.  The advertisement also emphasized how "the Waggon-seats...[are] set on springs." This suggests the growth of stage-coach use, as an increasing amount of passengers complaining about rough riding conditions must have swayed the owners to implement a new type of suspension system.<a href="#note46" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>46</sup></a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These stage coach-lines were eager for business, constantly trying to prove their efficiency and luxuriousness.  Joseph Richards and John Cluck partnered a stage route from New York City to Philadelphia.  They tried to tempt customers by the promise of "the quickest 30 or 40 hours" on the "cheapest and safest" stage route, in April, 1751.<a href="#note47" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>47</sup></a>   In July that same year, another pair bested the Richards-Cluck partnership, by offering to "go sooner from Philadelphia to New York, by 24 or 30 hours, than by any other way that has been made use of by stage."<a href="#note48" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>48</sup></a>   In a way, this contest to be the quickest is symbolic of the changes in New Jersey taking place in the eighteenth century.  The desire to be easily connected to either New York City or Philadelphia was solidifying New Jersey, bringing the two halves closer together, not so much physically, but as a community.  This is reflected in the stage-coach advertisements, which kept decreasing the estimated time to travel through New Jersey to the important cities.  New York City and Philadelphia were not growing closer together, but the people in New Jersey's two halves were, fueled by their growing acceptance of being in a colony of transportation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There were also many advertisements for land sales, some of which employ interesting wording.  Newspaper advertisements for land were common, as this was one of the few ways it could be widely marketed.  It is not unusual to dress up an advertisement in hopes of attracting greater interest.  Advertisers in the eighteenth century were aware of the need to appeal to what people wanted or needed.  One of the tactics used to entice people to buy certain tracts of land in New Jersey was to promote its desirable location.  Earlier ads emphasized a convenient access to water first, and roads second.  In 1751, the New York Gazette offered a plot of land in Bound Brook that was "within 14 or 15 Rods of Raritan River, and bounded on Raritan Road."<a href="#note49" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>49</sup></a>   As the roads grew in prominence they became the centerpiece of the advertisement.  A 1766 advertisement in the New York Gazette for a parcel of land located in Amwell Township of Hunterdon County demonstrates this.  After giving the more formal details, the author mentions how the land is "equally situated to answer New York and Philadelphia markets."<a href="#note50" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>50</sup></a>   Another advertisement in the New York Gazette that same year marketed land for sale near Elizabeth that was seized by the Sheriff.  The land was located "on the post road from Elizabeth Town to Woodbridge," which "makes it very convenient for a merchant, tavern-keeper, or tradesman."<a href="#note51" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>51</sup></a>   Since these three occupations were some of the most common, the ad seems to say that a close proximity to important roadways was imperative, no matter who you were or what job you had.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tavern-keepers were especially keen to acknowledge the importance of these connector roads.  Roadways between New York City and Philadelphia were bound to have the most amount of traffic, which is something a tavern-keeper would want to take advantage of.  Taverns were an essential part of overland travel, being places where passengers could rest and get a hot meal, and the operators could change horses.  The New Jersey State Archives has sections for tavern license petitions for each county.  In the archival holdings for Hunterdon County, Amwell Township has 286 pages.  The township with the next highest number of tavern petitions is Trenton, with 187 pages worth of documents.<a href="#note52" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>52</sup></a>  Amwell Township, with the highest quantity of tavern petitions, has the Old York Road running through (Figure 3.1).  Along the Old York Road ran one of the most popular stage-coach routes in the colony, the Swift Sure Stage-Coach Line (Figure 3.2), which began advertising in the New York Gazette in 1769.<a href="#note53" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>53</sup></a>   These numbers demonstrate how the roadways connecting New York City and Philadelphia were viewed with a special importance.  With the exception of Trenton, no longer part of Hunterdon County, Amwell Township was the only place in the county with one of these popular connecting roads.  Therefore, it is easy to understand why it was this township with the highest quantity of tavern petitions, most of which, likely, were either located along the Old York Road, or on smaller roads that branched off from this important link.  Prospective tavern-keepers were eager to set up shop on roads like the Old York Road, aware of the potential traffic these roads supported.  Tavern keeping was one business that was eager to embrace the flow of travelers between New York City and Philadelphia.  New Jersey's purpose as a gateway is seen not only in advertisements and tavern records, but in personal accounts as well.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Significant historic events have a way of creating certain types of folklore that become associated with specific areas.   In his diary, Claude Blanchet details his way through New Jersey in September, 1781, as a member of Washington's army during the American Revolution.  He mentions stopping at Suffern, New York, and described the land as "mountainous and middling."  When he crossed into New Jersey on his way to Pompton, and then to Whippany, he wrote how the roads there were "very level", and "continue... to be fine."<a href="#note54" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>54</sup></a>   It could be argued that the roads and land in New York were not in as good of shape because it is a large place, unlike New Jersey, which is smaller and more compressed.  It is far less of a burden to develop a small area than a large one like New York.  However, this furthers the argument that New Jersey had a special importance placed on its roads.  About a year later, Blanchet once again found himself in New Jersey, having to cross from Philadelphia to New York City.  After making it to Trenton, he wrote how "we were not far from New York."<a href="#note55" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>55</sup></a>   Despite the comfortable conditions of the New Jersey roads, mentioned above, he seemed eager to arrive in New York.  Of course, this was during war time, so he was not interested in a long stay in the Garden State.  What is worth noting is his point that Trenton is not far from New York.  The road from Philadelphia to Trenton is not an arduous journey, Trenton being situated along the banks of the Delaware north of Philadelphia.  From this sentence, the author gives a clue as to the way New Jersey was perceived.  He was in the middle of the state, on the western-most edge, and he needed to go to the northeastern part of the state, where one enters New York City.  This is roughly equidistant to the length it takes to go from Philadelphia to New York City, and he considers it "not far."  This demonstrates how New Jersey, any part of it, can be seen as being "not far" from either New York City or Philadelphia.  This type of thinking forms part of the New Jersey legacy that persists up to the present, where any place in the state is always close to one of the neighboring, big cities.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New Jersey’s close proximity to New York City and Philadelphia is presented not only in peoples' words, but their actions.  Apart from traveling to either of these two cities in a stage-coach, or by horse, there were the less fortunate who had to make their way through New Jersey on foot.  It was reported that on March 25, 1766, a murder was committed “upon a Man who was travelling on Foot from New-York to Philadelphia.”  He was found “on the Road”, and at times was in the company of two other men who were “likewise travelling on Foot the same Way.”<a href="#note56" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>56</sup></a>   This maintains the notion of New Jersey always being close to either New York City or Philadelphia.  The unfortunate victim, perhaps unable to pay stage-coach fare, must not have thought that the trip was too long to walk.  He was obviously familiar with the length, because he was a Philadelphian native.  This cannot be viewed as an isolated episode, as he encountered traveling companions who were also making the journey on foot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There were also important political figures that saw the importance of New Jersey's geographic position.  In a letter to the legislature in 1768, the last Royal Governor of New Jersey, William Franklin, said, "those roads which lie between the two chief trading cities in America, are seldom passable without danger or difficulty."<a href="#note57" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>57</sup></a>   Even though by this time there were roads connecting the two cities, as well as stage-coach routes, Governor Franklin saw the need to improve both the roads and their accessibility.  At a time when amphibious travel was seen as paramount to overland travel, Franklin still felt the issue needed to be addressed.  Presumably, this is not something that he would idly say without it being of pressing urgency.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The American Revolution played a certain part in this development.  The argument can be proposed that the battles in New Jersey during this struggle, and the imagery of the state being the crossroads of the Revolution, were responsible for advancing the purpose.  It is even around this time when the titles of East or West Jersey began to disappear, and in 1787, a single, the State of New Jersey was recognized.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This shift from plural to singular New Jersey can be viewed from a more cynical angle.  The rhetoriticians and pamphleteers during the revolutionary struggle would have been apprehensive to label New Jersey as anything but a single, united colony or state.  This would have been counterproductive to the “united we stand” ethos of the patriots.  Around this time, it was still not clear exactly whether New Jersey was one or two provinces.  Lewis Morris, Governor of New Jersey from 1738-1746, in a letter to the Lord of Trade in 1739, discussed the problem with the two alternating governments in New Jersey.  He said how the "present method of alternate Sittings of the Assemblyes & Courts, & keeping two Secrataries, Offices...[was] Very inconvenient and burthensome."<a href="#note58" style="text-decoration: none"><sup>58</sup></a>   This was roughly twenty five years before ideas about separation from England began to weave through the American consciousness.  Still, there existed uncertainty about New Jersey's fate, evidenced by the fact that government administrations had to alternate between Amboy in East Jersey, and Burlington in West Jersey.  Patriots and Sons of Liberty had to keep New Jersey united, and present the colony as a whole, instead of two separate parts.  How would it seem to the rest of the country, as well as nations in Europe, if New Jersey was having internal strife, unable to recognize itself as a united entity?
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This development was not a sudden process, but a slow and evolving one.  New Jersey found a place for itself, interestingly enough, by looking to its neighbors.  With so much potential to split apart, New Jersey retained its identity by providing a service that could not be matched.  The colony's location was crucial to its purpose.  The roadways running the course between New York City and Philadelphia were, and continue to be, New Jersey's offering.  These roads indirectly provided New Jersey with its claim, legacy, and heritage that has not abated since the eighteenth century.  Even today, when looking at a road map of New Jersey, one can be overwhelmed by the spider-like network of roads.  New Jersey is perhaps the only state today with such a complex and dizzying arrangement of roads, without containing any of the more populous cities in the country.  Many of these roads are concentrated in the direction between New York City and Philadelphia.  The New Jersey Turnpike resembles a modern, more direct route between these two cities, paying tribute to the colonial roadways that came before it.  It was during the American Revolution that New Jersey was presented as a single, united state, regardless of the century of disunion that had existed within the colony.  New Jersey's legacy and purpose were being created before this conflict, but it was during it that New Jerseyites began to acknowledge and embrace their colony's role.  The undeniable importance of New Jersey as a throughway has been growing ever since.

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Throughout this paper, I have shown that New Jersey's confused origins, and the grounds by which it was unable to reconcile the two halves as parts of the whole during its colonial history.  The people in British-North American, as well as those in England, first viewed East Jersey and West Jersey as two separate provinces.  The one thing that was able identify the colony during this early period was the concept of New Jersey acting as the throughway between New York City and Philadelphia.  The roadways which assisted this movement became the symbol of a New Jersey identity or purpose, which in turn, have passed into the modern era as a heritage or legacy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In a broad sense, this paper serves to demonstrate the way in which a state or regional identity can be nurtured by infrastructure.  The location of New Jersey plays an important part in this formation, but the impact of roads cannot be stressed enough.  The two were bound together, with a connected dynamic.  This New Jersey identity could not have formed without a considerable interest in the roads joining New York City and Philadelphia.  More than just transportation, the colonial roads enhanced the desirability of New Jersey.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This thesis, and the themes discussed, are hopefully only the beginning of a deep interpretation of New Jersey identity.  There is room for future historians to continue analyzing and developing the early stages of New Jersey's "traveling culture".  A large part of my work focuses on the Old York Road, which is just one of the early colonial roadways through New Jersey.  There were many other linking roads, some of which predate the Old York Road.  Research into some of these roadways would be worth the effort, since they had their own stage-coach routes and taverns.  In addition, the various towns along these routes should be studied for certain population trends.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Research also remains to be done on the southeast and northwest of New Jersey.  These sections are omitted from my work, since they were thinly populated throughout much of the eighteenth century, and I focus instead on the area between New York City and Philadelphia.  Still, the effort will pay off by validating my conclusions, or by discovering different developments relevant to these areas and their own "traveling cultures."
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The arguments in this paper could also be analyzed in post-revolutionary New Jersey.  My research ends when New Jersey reaches statehood.  One reason for this was the goal of identifying the early stages of New Jersey's "traveling culture".  It is also because early in the nineteenth century, the advent of railroads and canals dramatically changed the landscape and nature of transportation.  Exploration into these two modes of transportation may likely provide similar results as the roads.  However, it is possible that the desire and implementation of rails and canals were based on, and resulted in, different outcomes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Other colonies and states should be studied as well.  The formation of identities and legacies can be attributed to a wide array of developments, not just roadways as was the case in New Jersey.  Other areas will most likely have different things to offer, and the roots of heritage are often not easily traced, but require careful attention coupled with acute examination.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These questions are important to understanding the collective American experience.  Regardless of the reasons or influences associated with legacies and identity, the concepts and methods are universal.  The United States, like New Jersey, is an amalgamation of different people and beliefs, but who are able to see themselves as something more than just the product of staunchly defined regions or states.  I am optimistic that this research will be used as the basis for further exploration into perceptions that are based on region, state, or nation, and the underlying causes that produce them.  It will be the job of future historians to investigate and trace these conditions.  It is my hope that during their research, they operate in an unorthodox manner, probing for unused sources and under analyzed documents, opting to take the metaphorical road less traveled.
